The code creates dense vector embeddings using the SentenceTransformer library with the "BAAI/bge-large-en" model. These embeddings transform text into high-dimensional numerical representations (specifically 1,024 dimensions for the bge-large-en model) where semantic similarity between texts is captured as vector proximity. The embeddings are normalized to ensure consistent comparison and stored in Supabase with their original text and metadata, enabling efficient similarity searches through vector operations. The system also generates a unique hash of each embedding for verification and tracking purposes.
